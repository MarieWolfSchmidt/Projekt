Things to consider changing in the basis version: 

Well things can work as they are - if something should be changed it should be that CheckersModel is rewritten
to have less functions inside of it.

1. Consider changing the CheckersModel so that it has less functions.
	- It would be great to move the majority of the functions to another class and just call those functions from that class.
	
2. Redoing the functions in CheckersModel so that they have a return value. 
	- This would make them less dependent on their placement in the code and therefore easier to change CheckersModel.
